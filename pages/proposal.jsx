        <p>
          <strong>Repurposed</strong> is a micro-enterprise converting food-grade tins into small
          planters sold through local outlets. We propose piloting this program with{" "}
          <strong>Sacred Heart Mission (SHM) op shops</strong> as the first sales points, giving SHM
          clients the chance to earn stipends or vouchers through low-barrier, creative micro-tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          With SHM’s <em>in-principle support</em>, we will then seek third-party funding to scale
          the model and extend distribution to City of Melbourne cafés and additional partners.
          Content below is illustrative and subject to partner input.
